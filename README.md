To run my application run npm install to recieve all the dependencies. Then also in the terminal run the command npm run watch, but make sure in your package.json you have a watch script with "webpack-dev-server --inline --hot" and build script with "webpack". Running npm run watch will start up the app on localhost:8080. Type anything you would like and then you can delete the note.
